		 * What is type casting?
		 * type casting is converting one data type to another
		 * why should i learn about type casting?
		 * so that we can use the code that is written by someone else to make our easier 
		 * or when we will be working in teams we will be able to merge the code
		 * What is the syntax for type casting
		 * when we are converting something from smaller to larger we don't need to do anything
		 * it happens automatically we just assign the variable for example
		 * 
		 * int box =1234;
		 * 
		 * long box2=box; // this is how it works and it is called implicit or widening automatically
		 * 
		 * however when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type
		 * then this is how we do it
		 * 
		 * long box=12345454;
		 * 
		 * int box2=(int) box; narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
		 *
